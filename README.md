# Portfolio-Optimization
In this case study, we will build two $10,000 investment portfolios containing four stocks. The first portfolio will have an equal weighting between the stocks. The second portfolio will be optimized with a weighting allocation that provides the best return, adjusted for risk. To build these two portfolios, we will:

Import two years of data for four stocks
Build the initial portfolio with equal weighting to each of the stocks
Analyze and visualize the equal-weighted portfolio
Generate 10,000 portfolio scenarios with random weighting to each of the stocks
Identify the optimal portfolio from the scenarios and visualize the results
